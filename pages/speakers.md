# Call For Speakers

### Background

> The [Linux Users' Group of Davis](http://www.lugod.org/) (LUGOD) is a
> 501(c)7 not-for-proift, founded in 1999. Our goals include advocating
> Linux and other Free and Open Source Software in the local community,
> educating and supporting each other, and providing a local social
> network of people interested in Linux and related topics.
> 
> Since its inception, our group has remained very active, holding both
> [general meetings](/meeting/past/) and social gatherings each month
> and running [Installfest workshops](/if/). We can also sometimes be
> found [exhibiting](/projects/#attends) at local technical conferences
> and other events.

### Diverse and Well-Connected

> By speaking at LUGOD, you'll have the opportunity to present to a
> [diverse group of individuals](/members/), including students and
> faculty from [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu/), IT professionals
> from around the state capitol, and, of course, hobbiests.
> 
> LUGOD does its best to cater to all technical levels of our
> membership. We [gauge meeting topics](/geekometer/), and provide
> mailing lists for both [general Linux discussion](/mailinglists/#vox)
> as well as [more technical topics](/mailinglists/#vox-tech).
> 
> Our group actively [promotes our meetings in the
> community](/documents/howtos/publicity-howto/), and at the same time
> keeps our own membership informed about the [activities of our
> neighbor user groups](/calendar/) We also keep
> [records](/meeting/past/) and [photographs of our previous
> meetings](/photos/), and an [archive of our speakers' presentation
> notes](/presentations/).
