# LUGOD on Social Networks

* * *

If you use social networks, such as [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/), you can interact and connect with other members of the Linux Users' Group of Davis by joining our communities on these networks.:

*   Facebook  
    Facebook is a social network that originally began at Harvard, eventually opening up to more schools, businesses, and eventually the general public.
    *   [LUGOD Page on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LinuxUsersGroupOfDavis)1
