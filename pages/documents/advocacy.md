    Based on the success of the "Open Source for Windows" handout, this was created for dispersal to 'average' computer users (e.g., for placement on the information kiosk at the Davis Public Library). It covers the basic concept of Open Source, describes some key companies and organizations which use it, and lists a number of software titles available for Linux, Windows (and, in some cases, Mac OS X).
