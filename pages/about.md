## About Us

The Linux Users' Group of Davis is a 501(c)(7) non-profit computer club serving the Sacramento region, consisting 
of people who share an interested in the Linux® operating system, Free & Open Source software and other related topics 
technical and non-technical.

Our goals are to advocate the use of Linux and Open Source, to educate the community on these software alternatives, 
support and provide a social network for local Linux users.

LUGOD holds regular meetings twice a month. On the first Tuesday of each month, we hold a social gathering at a 
or café, and on the third Monday of each month we meet at the Davis Public Library to listen to informative presentations 
speakers (day, time and location may be subject to change).

We also hold events and workshops and maintain a number of active mailing lists, and 
channel.

Our meetings, events and membership, are free and open to the general public. Join us!
