## What We've Received

LUGOD is a non-profit, community-base organization. Consequently we depend on donations of things, money, and especially time. A list of all monetary donations can be seen on our [ledger](/devnull/ledger/). Everyone who has donated their time to presenting at our meetings can be seen on our [past meetings page](/meeting/past/). Also see our [LUGODers of the Quarter](/members/lugoders/), members who have given particularly distinguished service to LUGOD. Businesses that have sponsored LUGOD are listed on our [sponsors page](/sponsors/).

Our apologies to donors whose names we have inadvertantly omitted.
