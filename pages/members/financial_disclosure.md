# Financial Disclosure and Ledger

* * *

LUGOD maintains a completely open ledger sheet and release our financial statement as public information. We feel that if we are going to accept your donations of time, effort, hardware and funds it is only fair that you be completely informed on where those resources are being spent.

Note: As a 501(c)(7) organization, donations are _not_ deductable as charitable contributions on your federal income tax return, alas.

If you wish to donate, you may make donations payable to:

> LUGOD  
> Attn: Will Marshall  
> PO Box _1336_  
> Davis, CA 95617  

If you want a receipt, please include a note to that effect, together with the address at which you want to receive your receipt, and we will return it to you by mail.

*   [Ledger](ledger/)  
    A list of contributions and expenditures.
    
*   [Donations](donations/)  
    Notable items donated to the club.
    
*   [Reimbursement form](reimbursement_form.txt) ([Postscript version](reimbursement_form.ps))  
    Volunteers who wish to be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses should use this form. The treasurer reserves the right to beat you with a large stick if you fail to fill out this form and attach receipts before asking for reimbursement ;-). (Just kidding about the large stick part.)
