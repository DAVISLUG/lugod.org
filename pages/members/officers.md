In his spare time he writes Open Source games and educational software, and runs an annual retrocomputing & classic gaming event. His interest in Unix and Linux began in college, and was fueled by his frustration with using Windows95 on a roommate's computer. As of 2017, he lives in Washington state, but still helps LUGOD out when he can!
