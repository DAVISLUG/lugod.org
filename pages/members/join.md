### Joining

Joining LUGOD is free and easy! No membership dues are required. Anyone may join - you do not need to be a student of UC Davis, nor do you need to be a resident of Davis, CA.

All you need to do is fill out a membership form during one of our [regular meetings](/meeting/). They are available near the door, along with club info. pamphlets and other free hand-outs.

(A printable version of this form is available in [OpenOffice ODT](lugod-signup-form-oct-2018.odt) and [PDF](lugod-signup-form-oct-2018.pdf) formats.)
