# Members - Past Officers

* * *

This page lists all of LUGOD's previous elected officers (root, sys, typescript and /dev/null), for posterity. (Our **current** elected and appointed officers are listed on the [officers](../) page.)

LUGOD was founded in January 1999 by Pete Salzman (see his [call for formation](/documents/history/beginning.txt) from December 1998), with help from others in the Davis community. Our Bylaws and Constitution were ratified in August 1999. We received 501(c)7 non-profit status in March 2000.

**Note:** This page was first created nearly 6 years after LUGOD was formed! Did we forget anyone or get any details wrong? If so, please contact the [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@lugod.org)!

Also, this page currently focuses on elected officers. We may add appointed positions as well, though that was not kept track of in nearly as much detail as elected positions...
