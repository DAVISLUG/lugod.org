## The Redesign

The LUGOD website has come a long way from its start [back in 1999](http://web.archive.org/web/19991007030450/https://www.lugod.org/). Shout out to Marianne Waage for the original site design, of which I am a big fan. The most recent iteration of the site was a [custom PHP site](http://web.archive.org/web/20181002005929/https://www.lugod.org/) written by cofounder Bill Kendrick. The codebase was very well written and clean, but it was complex enough to hinder beginners from making any real changes to the site. After some discussions and testing, we decided to migrate the site to a setup that was easier to work with, and that newcomers could understand.

In choosing a new platform, we wanted to go with a setup where people could add a new page via Markdown. Several members voted for a static site generator as opposed to a CMS or Wiki type setup in order to simplify editing and deployment while maintaining a well-defined structure. After trying out a few static site generators on [https://staticgen.com], including [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), we decided to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because of its simple learning curve, large userbase, tight integration with Github pages, and broad functionality out of the box.
