## The Redesign
The LUGOD website has come a long way from its start [back in 1999](http://web.archive.org/web/19991007030450/https://www.lugod.org/). The most recent iteration was a [hand-rolled PHP site](http://web.archive.org/web/20181002005929/https://www.lugod.org/) with a lot of clean code, but a lot of quirks. At a glance, the codebase was well written, but it was complex enough in practice to hinder beginners from making changes to the site. We decided it was time to migrate to a setup that was easier to work with, and that newcomers could understand.

In choosing a new platform, we wanted to go with a static site generator to simplify deployment and contribution, and to give some well-defined and well-documented structure to the codebase. After trying out a few options on [https://staticgen.com], including [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), we decided to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because of its relatively simple learning curve, tight integration with Github pages, and  broad functionality out of the box.
